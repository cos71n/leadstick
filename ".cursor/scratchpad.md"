**ðŸ“§ EMAIL ISSUE RESOLUTION**:
**Problem**: Widget working but emails not being sent (Resend logs empty)
**Root Cause**: RESEND_API_KEY secret not properly accessible by worker
**Solution**: Re-set secret with `npx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY` and redeployed
**Verification**: API test now returns `"email":"sent"` instead of `"email":"failed"`

**ðŸŽ¯ READY FOR PRODUCTION**:
The widget is now 100% ready for deployment on poolcost.com.au. Simply add this single line before `</body>`:

```html
<script src="https://pub-2cf19529958742fea36d2ac68c558716.r2.dev/leadstick.umd.js" async></script>
```

**No configuration needed** - it will automatically:
- Show responsive mobile/desktop interfaces
- Process leads through 3-step qualification
- Send emails to `michael.costin@localdigital.com.au`
- Track attribution and GA4 events

**Fresh Cloudflare deployment from corrupted state to fully operational widget: COMPLETE!** ðŸŽ‰
